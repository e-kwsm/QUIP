Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Fracture in Quartz
***************************************************

*This tutorial has not been updated for the Python 3 rewrite of quippy.
It is hosted here for archival purposes*

This tutorial was prepared for use at a hands-on session at the
`Advanced Oxide Interfaces Workshop
<http://cdsagenda5.ictp.it/full_display.php?ida=a10139>`_, ICTP,
Trieste, May 2011.

Setting up your working environment
-----------------------------------

In this tutorial we are going to be using the `QUIP
<http://www.libatoms.org>`_ (short for QUantum mechanics and
Interatomic Potentials) code, which is a molecular dynamics code
written in Fortran 95 and equipped with a Python interface named
`quippy <http://www.jrkermode.co.uk/quippy>`_.

As well as working with the standard unix command line we'll also be
using `ipython`, an interactive Python shell. In the listings below,
shell commands are prefixed by a `$` to identify them; everything else
is a Python command which should be typed into the `ipython` shell. If
you're not familiar with Python don't worry, it's quite easy to pickup
and the syntax is very similar to Fortran.

This tutorial assumes you have installed `QUIP` and `quippy`; see the
:ref:`installation` section if you need some help on doing this.

.. To get started, you should set up your working environment with the
.. following shell command::

..    $ source /afs/ictp/public/shared/adglass/jkermode/start.sh

.. This sets up a few environment variables and gives you access to the
.. `QUIP` and `quippy` codes. The `$ADGLASS` environment variable should
.. now point to a directory containing the input files you'll need.

.. You will need to repeat this command in every new terminal you open
.. (or add it to the end of your `~/.cshrc` startup file).



Starting a fracture simulation
------------------------------

To maximise the amount of progress that we can make in the hands-on
session, the first task is to get a fracture simulation running.

We're going to be modelling a crack in :math:`\alpha`-quartz opening
on the basal plane :math:`(0001)`, with the crack front parallel to
the :math:`[\bar{1}10]` direction. The input structure is an
:download:`XYZ file <quartz_crack.xyz>` contains a :math:`150~\AA
\times 50 \AA` crack system with around 4000 atoms. The `y` axis is
aligned with the :math:`(0001)` plane, and the `z` axis with the
:math:`[\bar{1}10]` direction. The system contains a seed crack under
uniaxial tension in the `y` direction with a strain of 23%.

.. image:: quartz_seed_crack.png
  :width: 600
  :align: center

Download the following input files:

  1. :download:`quartz_crack.xyz` - the input structure, pictured above
  2. :download:`quartz_crack.xml` - parameters for potential and molecular dynamics
  3. :download:`quartz_crack_bulk.xyz` - structure of the quartz primitive cell

Before we begin, we need to make sure that the QUIP `crack` program is compiled
by running the following commands::

  $ export QUIP_ARCH=linux_x86_64_gfortran # or whichever arch is relevant
  $ cd $QUIP_ROOT
  $ make Programs/crack

Then press `enter` to accept default settings.

.. Note::

  The value you should assign to the variable :envvar:`QUIP_ARCH` depends on your
  platform (see :ref:`installation` for more details). :envvar:`QUIP_ROOT`
  refers to the directory where the the QUIP source code is located.

To make the command `crack` available, copy the executable
``${QUIP_ROOT}/build/${QUIP_ARCH}`` to a directory on your :envvar:`PATH`,
e.g. ``~/bin``.

Similarly, to compile `eval` run::

  $ make QUIP_Programs/eval

It is highly recommended to change the name when copying the `eval` program to a
directory on :envvar:`PATH` to avoid a clash with the builtin ``eval`` command.

Start the simulation by running the `crack` program, which takes
the "stem" of the input filenames as its only argument::

  $ crack quartz_crack > quartz_crack.out &

Note that we're redirecting the output to `quartz_crack.out` and
running `crack` in the background. As well as outputting status
information to `quartz_crack.out`, the simulation will periodically
write the MD trajectory to a file named `quartz_crack_movie_1.xyz`.

You can monitor the progress of the simulation by opening the
trajectory file with my `modified version
<http://www.jrkermode.co.uk/AtomEye>`_ of `AtomEye`::

   $ A quartz_crack_movie_1.xyz

In `AtomEye`, you can move the system within the periodic boundaries
to centre it in the middle of the cell by holding `Shift` and dragging
with your left mouse button, or by pressing `Shift+z`. Zoom in and out
by dragging with the right mouse button. Press `b` to toggle the
display of bonds. You can use the `Insert` and `Delete` keys to move
forwards or backwards through the trajectory - note the frame number
in the title bar of the window. You can quit `AtomEye` by pressing `q`.

For more help on `AtomEye` see its `web page
<http://mt.seas.upenn.edu/Archive/Graphics/A>`_ or my notes on this
`modified version <http://www.jrkermode.co.uk/AtomEye>`_. In
particular, you might find this :download:`startup file <atomeyerc>`
useful (copy to `~/.A` to use).

Have a look at the output in `quartz_crack.out`. To see how the
simulation is progressing, you can search this for lines starting with
"D"::

  $ grep "^D " quartz_crack.out

The first number gives the time in femtoseconds (the integration
timestep of 0.5 fs is chosen to accurately sample the highest
frequency phonon mode in the system), and the second and third are the
instantaneous and time-averaged temperatures in Kelvin. The average
temperature is computed using an `exponential moving average
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Exponential_moving_average>`_.

After a few hundred femtoseconds, you should see the crack start to
propagate in a fairly steady way, similar to the snapshot shown below
(as a rough guide you can expect the simulation to progress at a
rate of about 2 picoseconds per hour).

.. image:: quartz_running_crack.png
   :width: 600
   :align: center

The simulation is run in the `NVT` ensemble, where the number of atoms
`N`, volume `V` and temperature `T` are kept constant. The system is
relatively small so a thermostat is used to regulate the
temperature. The accelerating crack gives out a lot of energy, and
since the thermostat used here is relatively weak, to avoid unduly
influencing the dynamics, the temperature will initially rise before
settling down once the crack reaches its equilibrium velocity.

Keep your crack simulation running as you proceed with the next parts
of the tutorial (avoid closing the terminal in which you started the
job!).

Quartz Primitive Unit Cell
--------------------------

While the fracture simulation is running, we will try to predict the
expected behaviour of a crack in quartz according to continuum
elasticity. We'll start by performing some calculations on the quartz
primitive cell using `quippy`.

Start `ipython` and import all the `quippy` routines::

   $ ipython
   ...
   In [1]: from quippy import *

Construct an :math:`\alpha`-quartz primitive unit cell and save it to
an XYZ file::

  aq = alpha_quartz(a=4.84038097073, c=5.3285240037, u=0.464175616171,
    x=0.411742710542, y=0.278727453998, z=0.109736032769)
  aq.write("quartz.xyz")

Here `a` and `c` are the lattice parameters (in :math:`\AA`), `u` is
the internal displacement of the silicon atoms and `x`, `y`, and `z`
the internal coordinates of the oxygens (see image below).

.. image:: quartz_unit_cell.png
   :width: 300
   :align: center

The variable `aq` is referred to as :class:`Atoms` object. It contains
various attributes representing the system of interest which you can
inspect from the `ipython` command line, e.g. to print out the lattice
vectors, which are stored as columns in the :attr:`~Atoms.lattice` matrix ::

   print aq.lattice

Or to print the atomic number and position of the first atom ::

   print aq.z[1], aq.pos[1]

If you want to find out the syntax for a `quippy` function, type its
name following by a question mark, e.g. ::

   alpha_quartz ?

will print out the function signature and list of parameter types, as
well as a brief description of what :func:`alpha_quartz()` does. If
you are interested in learning more about using `QUIP` and `quippy`,
you could take a look at the online :ref:`tutorial-intro`.

Keep your `ipython` session open as we'll need it later. Open the
`quartz.xyz` file you created with `AtomEye`. You should see something
like this:

.. image:: quartz.png
  :width: 300
  :align: center

You can also download :download:`quartz.xyz` for comparison.

.. note::

  The main advantage of `AtomEye` is that it scales well to very
  larger systems, and does a pretty good job of understanding periodic
  boundary conditions. However, it can be a bit confusing for small
  cells like this. Since the quartz primitive cell contains only 9
  atoms, `AtomEye` doubles the unit cell along the short lattice
  vectors (`a` and `b`) resulting in 36 atoms.

Calculating Elastic Properties
------------------------------

In order to predict the onset and velocity of fracture, we need to
determine the values of the Young's modulus :math:`E`, the Poisson
ratio :math:`\nu`, surface energy density :math:`\gamma` and the
Rayleigh Wave speed :math:`c_R`. These are all properties of the
classical potential which in this case is a short-ranged version of
the TS polarisable potential (see `this paper
<http://jcp.aip.org/resource/1/jcpsa6/v133/i9/p094102_s1>`_ in
*J. Chem. Phys.* for more about this potential).

Apart from :math:`\gamma`, all of these quantities can be obtained
from the :math:`6 \times 6` matrix of elastic constants
:math:`C_{ij}`, so we will start by calculating this.

:math:`C` is defined by :math:`\bm\sigma = C\bm\epsilon` where :math:`\bm\sigma` and
:math:`\bm\epsilon` are six component stress and strain vectors following
the Voigt convention:

.. math::
  \bm\sigma  = \left( \sigma_{xx}, \sigma_{yy}, \sigma_{zz},
      \sigma_{yz}, \sigma_{xz}, \sigma_{xy} \right)

  \bm\epsilon = \left( \varepsilon_{xx}, \varepsilon_{yy}, \varepsilon_{zz},
      2\,\varepsilon_{yz}, 2\,\varepsilon_{xz}, 2\,\varepsilon_{xy} \right)

The simplest way to calculate :math:`C` with `QUIP` is to use the
command line QUIP `eval` program. You will need the file `quartz.xyz`
you made earlier, as well as an :download:`XML file <TS_params.xml>`
containing the parameters of the classical potential::

 $ eval init_args="IP TS" at_file=quartz.xyz param_file=TS_params.xml cij

Here `init_args` describes the kind of potential to use, `at_file` is
the file containing the unit cell and `param_file` is the potential
parameters. `cij` tells the `eval` program that we want it to
calculate the elastic constants; this is done using the virial stress
tensor. Have a look inside `TS_params.xml` to see the values which
give the potential parameters controlling short range repulsion,
Yukawa-screened Coulomb interaction and dipole polarisability. For
example you can see that oxygen (atomic number 8) is polarisable in
this model and silicon (atomic number 14) is not.

Make a file called `cij.dat` containing the matrix output by `eval`
(remove the "CIJ" at the beginning of each line). You can load this
matrix into `quippy` using the command ::

  C = loadtxt("cij.dat")

**Extension**: For trigonal crystals like :math:`\alpha`-quartz, there
are only actually 6 independent values in the :math:`C` matrix:

.. math::
   C = \left(
   \begin{array}{cccccc}
   C_{11} & C_{12} & C_{13} & C_{14} & 0 & 0\\
   C_{12} & C_{11} & C_{13} & -C_{14} & 0 & 0 \\
   C_{13} & C_{13} & C_{33} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
   C_{14} & -C_{14} & 0 & C_{44} & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & C_{44} & C_{14} \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & C_{14} & C_{66}
   \end{array}
   \right)

where :math:`C_{66}` is given by :math:`\frac{1}{2}(C_{11} -
C_{12})`. We can exploit this symmetry to get all these values using
only two strain patterns: :math:`\epsilon_{xx}` and
:math:`\epsilon_{yy}+\epsilon_{zz}`.

If you like, you could try using the following `quippy` code to
evaluate :math:`C` taking the crystal symmetry into account to see how
the results differ from those obtained with `eval`. ::

   p = Potential('IP TS', param_filename='TS_params.xml')
   C = elastic_constants(p, aq, graphics=False, sym='trigonal_low')

Which components are most different? Why do you think this is? Think
about the effect of internal relaxation: compare with the values of
the :math:`C^0_{ij}` tensor obtained if internal relaxation is not
allowed (use the `c0ij` option to the `eval` program). Why do you
think some components are particularly sensitive to internal
relaxation?

Young's Modulus and Poisson Ratio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To calculate the effective Young's modulus and Poisson ratio for our
quartz fracture simulation, we need to rotate the elastic constant
matrix to align it with the axes of our :math:`(0001)[\bar{1}10]`
fracture geometry. You can create the required rotation matrix using::

  R = rotation_matrix(aq, (0,0,0,1), (-1,1,0))
  print R

Next we transform :math:`C` using the rotation matrix, and calculate
the compliance matrix :math:`S = C^{-1}`::

  C_eff = transform_elasticity(C, R)
  S_eff = numpy.linalg.inv(C_eff)

`C` transforms as a rank-4 tensor since the full relation between
stress and strain is :math:`\sigma_{ij} = c_{ijkl} \epsilon_{kl}`,
meaning that the transformed tensor is

.. math::
   c'_{ijkl} = \sum_{p,q,r,s = 1}^{3} R_{pi}R_{qj}R_{rk}R_{sl} c_{pqrs}

Finally we can work out the values of the effective Young's modulus
and Poisson ratio in the standard way from the components of the
compliance matrix::

  E = 1/S_eff[2,2]
  print "Young's modulus", E, "GPa"

  nu = -S_eff[1,2]/S_eff[2,2]
  print "Poisson ratio", nu

**Extension**: Try rotating the quartz primitive cell directly::

  aqr = transform(aq, R)
  aqr.write("quartz_rotated.xyz")

Open `quartz_rotated.xyz` in AtomEye and confirm that it is oriented
so that the :math:`(0001)` surface is aligned with the vertical (`y`)
axis like the fracture system or `quartz_0001.xyz`, pictured
below. Use `eval` to directly compute the elastic constant matrix
of the rotated cell. How well does this matrix compare to `C_eff`?


Surface Energy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file :download:`quartz_0001.xyz` contains a 54 atom unit cell for
the (0001) surface of :math:`\alpha`-quartz (shown below). Use either
the QUIP `eval` program or `quippy` to calculate the surface energy
density :math:`\gamma` predicted by our classical potential for this
surface.

.. image::  quartz_0001.png
   :align: center

If you use `eval`, use the `E` command line option to get the program
to calculate the potential energy of the input cell. If you use
`quippy`, you should construct a :class:`Potential` object using the
XML parameters from the file `TS_params.xml` as shown above. You can
then calculate the energy using the :meth:`~Potential.calc()`
function - see the tutorial section on :ref:`moleculardynamics` for
more details.

.. note::

  The energy unit of QUIP are electron volt (eV), and the distance
  units are Angstrom (:math:`\AA`).

**Hint**: you can use the expression

.. math::

  \gamma = \frac{E_{surf} - E_{bulk}}{2A}

where :math:`E_{surf}` and :math:`E_{bulk}` are the energies of
surface and bulk configurations containing the same number of atoms,
and :math:`A` is the area of the open surface (with a factor of two
because there are two open surfaces in this unit cell).

You should get a value for :math:`\gamma` of around 3.5 J/m\ :sup:`2`.

**Extension**: what effect does relaxing the atomic positions have on
the surface energy? (use the `relax` argument to the `eval`
program, or the :meth:`~Potential.minim` function in `quippy`). What
happens if you anneal the surface using the `md` program? ::

  $ md pot_init_args="IP TS" params_in_file=TS_params.xml \
      atoms_in_file=quartz_0001.xyz dt=0.5 N_steps=1000

Which surface energy do you think is more relevant for predicting the
onset of fracture, relaxed or unrelaxed?

Energy Release Rate for Static Fracture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

According to continuum elasticity, the strain energy release rate of an
advancing crack is defined by

.. math::
 G = - \frac{\partial U_E}{\partial c}

where :math:`U_E` is the total strain energy and :math:`c` is the crack length.
The well-known Griffith criteria uses an energy-balance argument to
equate the critical value of :math:`G` at which fracture can first occur to
the energy required to create two new surfaces.

According to Griffith, we should expect crack propagation to become
favourable for :math:`G > 2\gamma`, where :math:`\gamma` is the
surface energy density.

Calculating `G` for a thin strip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are using the thin strip geometry illustrated below for our
fracture simulations, with the top and bottom edges fixed.

.. image:: thin-strip.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600

The advantage of this setup is that the energy release rate `G`
does not depend on the crack length, and can be found analytically by
considering the energetics of an advancing crack.

The horizontal edges of the strip are given a uniform normal
displacement :math:`\delta`, so the applied strain is
:math:`\epsilon_0 = \delta / h`.  Far ahead of the crack, the strip is
in uniaxial tension: :math:`\epsilon_{yy} \to \epsilon_0` as :math:`x
\to \infty`.

The stress far ahead of the crack is given by :math:`\sigma_{0} = E'
\epsilon_{0}`, and therefore the elastic energy per unit length and
per unit thickness far ahead of the crack tip is

.. math::
   W_\infty = \frac{1}{2}E'\epsilon_0^2\cdot 2h = \frac{\delta^2 E'}{h}

where :math:`E'` is the effective Young's modulus.

Far behind the tip, the energy density is zero. Since no energy
disappears through the clamped edges, if the crack is to advance by
unit distance, a vertical strip of material with energy density
:math:`W_\infty` is effectively replaced by a strip with energy
density zero.

The energy supplied to the crack tip is therefore equal to :math:`W_\infty`,
so the energy release rate is simply

.. math::
  G = W_\infty = \frac{\delta^2 E'}{h}

In our simulations we will use periodic boundary conditions in the :math:`z`
direction, so we have plane strain loading (:math:`\epsilon_{zz} = 0`),
which means that the effective Young's modulus :math:`E'` is given by
:math:`E/(1-\nu^2)`, where :math:`E` is the Young's modulus in the :math:`y` relevant
direction and :math:`\nu` is the Poisson ratio, so finally we have

.. math::
  G = \frac{E \delta^2}{(1- \nu^2)h} = \frac{E \epsilon_0^2 h}{1 - \nu^2}

Use your values for the Young's modulus, Poisson ratio and surface
energy to calculate the value of :math:`G` (in units of J/m\ :sup:`2`)
and strain :math:`\epsilon` at which a sample of :math:`\alpha`-quartz
with a height of 50 :math:`\AA` is expected to fracture according to
the continuum Griffith criterium. How does this compare to the initial
strain we applied to our fracture specimen?

Changing the loading of the fracture system
-------------------------------------------

Once your crack simulation should has run for a couple of picoseconds
the crack should have reached its terminal velocity so you can stop
the simulation (you can do this nicely creating an empty file named
`stop_run`, or simply by killing the process).

We are going to take the current state of the simulation and rescale
it homogeneously to change the applied load. We will then continue the
simulation starting from the rescaled system. In this way we will be
able to investigate the relationship between the loading `G` and the
equilibrium crack velocity `V`.

You should find a file named `quartz_crack_check.xyz` in your job
directory. This is a checkpoint file which contains a full snapshot
of all the instantaneous positions and velocities of the atoms in the
system. Load this file into `quippy` and rescale it as follows::

  a = Atoms('quartz_crack_check.xyz')
  params = CrackParams('quartz_crack.xml')

  b = crack_rescale_homogeneous_xy(a, params, new_strain)
  b.write('quartz_crack_rescaled.xyz')

Replace `new_strain` with the target strain which should be between
0.15 and 0.30. If you inspect the new file `quartz_crack_rescaled.xyz`
you should see it's identical to the original apart from the rescaling
in the `x` and `y` directions (not along `z` since the system is
periodic in that direction). Copy the bulk cell and XML parameters and
start a new crack simulation::

 $ cp quartz_crack_bulk.xyz quartz_crack_rescaled_bulk.xyz
 $ cp quartz_crack.xml quartz_crack_rescaled.xml
 $ crack quartz_crack_rescaled > quartz_crack_rescaled.out &

Wait for the restarted simulation to reach a steady state and then
estimate the crack velocity from looking at the XYZ file (right-click
on an atom in `AtomEye` to print out its position; the interval
between frames is 10 fs) or by plotting the crack position as a
function of time by extracting lines starting with `CRACK_TIP` from
the output file (you might find this :download:`crack-velo.sh` script
useful to do this; note however that the crack tip position is found
using the atomic coordination numbers so if there are defects in your
cell it will not work correctly).

Energy Release Rate for Dynamic Fracture
----------------------------------------

Freund extended this approach to dynamic fracture by writing the total
energy required to break bonds at the crack surface as the product of
the static energy release rate :math:`G` and a universal velocity-dependent
function which he showed can be approximated as a linear
function of the crack speed :math:`V`

.. math::
  2\gamma \sim G \left( 1 - \frac{V}{c_R} \right)

The Rayleigh surface wave speed :math:`c_R` sets the ultimate limit for the
crack propagation speed. The expected velocity as a function of the
loading :math:`G/2\gamma` is then

.. math::
  \frac{V}{c_R} = 1 - \frac{2 \gamma}{G}

This is the Freund equation of motion. Calculating the Rayleigh wave
speed - the speed with which elastic waves travel on a free surface - is
fairly straightforward for isotropic materials. For anisotropic
materials like quartz the calculation is more involved since the speed
will be different for wave propagation in different crystallographic
directions. For our case, the value turns out to be :math:`c_R \sim
9.3` km/s using the elastic constants calculated for the short-range
TS classical potential.

How does your measured value for the crack velocity compare to that
predicted by the Freund equation of motion for the same `G`?

At the end of the session we will try to combine everybody's results
to produce a plot of :math:`V(G)`.


Extension tasks
---------------

1. Look carefully at the MD trajectory from your fracture simulation
   in `AtomEye`. Do you notice anything about the bond-breaking events
   at the crack tip? How would you calculate the amount of charge
   which ends up on each of the cleaved surfaces?

2. What is the effect of changing the simulation temperature? Trying
   changing the value of `sim_temp` in the XML parameter file to
   something much larger, e.g. 1000 K. Is the fracture qualitatively
   different? What happens if you turn off the thermostat (change
   the `ensemble` setting from `NVT` to `NVE`).

3. The expression :math:`E_y = 1/S_{22}` is an approximation and is
   not strictly valid for hexagonal materials. Check this
   approximation by performing a tensile test: take the rotated
   configuration `aqr` apply a series of small strains in the `y`
   direction, and compute the stress using the classical potential,
   using code based on the following::

      p = Potential('IP TS', param_filename='TS_params.xml')
      ...
      T = numpy.diag([1., 1+.eps_yy, 1.])            # matrix for strain in y
      aqr_t = transform(aqr, T)                      # apply transformation
      p.calc(aqr_t, virial=True)                     # compute virial tensor
      sig_yy = -v[2,2]/aqr_t.cell_volume()*GPA       # convert to stress

   Calculate an improved estimate for :math:`E_y` by fitting a straight line
   to `sig_yy` as function of `eps_yy`. How good is the approximation
   we used above?

4. It's important to bear in mind that what we've done here is
   necessarily very approximate for a number of reasons:

   * This is a very small system
   * The applied loading is very large
   * The description of bond-breaking provided by classical potential is
     simplistic

   Which of these do you think is most important? How could these
   limitations be overcome in a more complete simulation?
