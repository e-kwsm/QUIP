Step 3: LOTF hybrid MD simulation of fracture in Si
===================================================

In the final part of this tutorial, we will be extending our previous script for
classical molecular dynamics to carry out an adaptive QM/MM simulation of
fracture using the 'Learn on the Fly' (LOTF) scheme.

You will need the ``run_crack_classical.py`` script from :ref:`step2`. If you
don't have it, you can :download:`download it here <run_crack_classical.py>`,
and the ``crack.xyz`` input file from :ref:`step1`, which you
can :download:`also download here <crack.xyz>`.

3.1 Initialisation of the QM/MM atomic system (20 minutes)
----------------------------------------------------------

Import the relevant modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make a copy of your ``run_crack_classical.py`` script and name it
``run_crack_lotf.py``. Add the following extra import statements after those
that are already there::

    from quippy.potential import ForceMixingPotential
    from quippy.lotf import LOTFDynamics, update_hysteretic_qm_region


Definition of the simulation parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _parameters3:

Next, we need to add some additional parameters specifically for the
QM/MM simulation. Again, insert them in ``run_crack_lotf.py``, below the
existing parameters ::

    qm_init_args = 'TB DFTB'         # Initialisation arguments for QM potential
    qm_inner_radius = 8.0*units.Ang  # Inner hysteretic radius for QM region
    qm_outer_radius = 10.0*units.Ang # Inner hysteretic radius for QM region
    extrapolate_steps = 10           # Number of steps for predictor-corrector
                                     # interpolation and extrapolation

The setup of the atomic structure and of the constraints is exactly the same as
before, so leave these sections of your script unchanged.

Setup of the QM and QM/MM potentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the QM/MM simulation, we first need to initialise the classical SW potential
(`mm_pot`) and the quantum-mechanical one (`qm_pot`). The two Hamiltonians then need
to be combined into a hybrid QM/MM potential (`qmmm_pot`), which mixes the QM
and MM forces.

Leave the initialisation of the SW classical potential as it is. After this, we
want to add some lines of code to setup the QM potential. Using the same
:class:`~quippy.potential.Potential` class, we initialise now the Density
functional tight binding (DFTB) potential. This is done by passing the new QM
`qm_init_args` as the `init_args` parameter and the same XML file as before for
the `param_filename` to the Potential constructor (note that the single file
``params.xml`` contains parameters for both the SW and DFTB potentials)::

    qm_pot = ...  # Initialise DFTB potential

The QM/MM potential is constructed using quippy's
:class:`quippy.potential.ForceMixingPotential` class. Here, `pot1` is
the low precision, i.e. MM potential, and `pot2` is the high
precision, i.e. QM potential. `fit_hops` is the number of hops used to
define the fitting region, `lotf_spring_hops` defines the length of
the springs in the LOTF *adjustable potential*, while the hysteretic
buffer options control the size of the :ref:`hysteretic <hysteretic>` :ref:`buffer
region <buffer>` region used for the embedded QM force calculation. ::

  qmmm_pot = ForceMixingPotential(pot1=mm_pot,
                                  pot2=qm_pot,
          atoms=atoms,
                                  qm_args_str='single_cluster cluster_periodic_z carve_cluster '+
                                              'terminate cluster_hopping=F randomise_buffer=F',
                                  fit_hops=4,
                                  lotf_spring_hops=3,
                                  hysteretic_buffer=True,
                                  hysteretic_buffer_inner_radius=7.0,
                                  hysteretic_buffer_outer_radius=9.0,
                                  cluster_hopping_nneighb_only=False,
                                  min_images_only=True)

The `qm_args_str` argument defines some parameters which control how
the QM calculation is carried out: we use a single cluster, periodic
in the `z` direction and terminated with hydrogen atoms. The positions
of the outer layer of buffer atoms are not randomised.

Change the line which sets the Atoms calculator to use the new
`qmmm_pot` Potential::

    atoms. ...  # Set the calculator


Set up the initial QM region
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now, we can set up the list of atoms in the initial QM region using
the :func:`~quippy.lotf.update_hysteretic_qm_region` function, defined
in quippy. Here we need to provide the :class:`~.Atoms` system, the
centre of the QM region (i.e. the position of the crack tip), and the
inner and outer radius of the :ref:`hysteretic <hysteretic>` QM
region. Note that the `old_qm_list` attribute must be an empty list
(``[]``) in this initial case::

    qm_list = ...             # Define the list of atoms in the QM region

The list needs to be attached to the `qmmm_pot` using the
:meth:`~quippy.potential.ForceMixingPotential.set_qm_atoms` method::

    qmmm_pot. ...             # Attach QM list to calculator


Milestone 3.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your ``run_crack_lotf.py`` script should look something
like :download:`run_crack_lotf_1.py`.

At this point you should run your script and check the initial QM region. For
testing, you should add a couple of temporary lines to force the script to
finish after setting the QM region and before repeating the classical MD::

  import sys
  sys.exit(0)

To visualise the initial QM region, you can type the following directly into
your `ipython` session (remember to do a ``from qlab import *`` first if you
haven't already)::

   view(atoms)
   aux_property_coloring(qmmm_pot.get_qm_atoms())

.. image:: crack-initial-qm-region.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600

In the image above, the red atoms are QM and the blue atom classical.
Internally, this list is actually saved as a :attr:`property
<~quippy.atoms.Atoms.properties>` inside the Atoms object named ``"hybrid"``,
which can also be displayed with ``aux_property_coloring("hybrid")``


3.2 Setup and run the adaptive QM/MM MD (20 minutes)
----------------------------------------------------

Initialising the Dynamics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The definition of the initial temperature of the system should be left as
in :ref:`Step 2 <step2>`. Don't forget to remove the temporary lines added above which
quit the script after setting up the initial QM region!

Instead of a traditional dynamics in the NVE ensemble, let's change the code to
use :ref:`LOTF predictor-corrector dynamics <lotf>`, using
the :class:`quippy.lotf.LOTFDynamics` class instead of
the :class:`~md.verlet.VelocityVerlet` class. We need to pass the following
arguments: `atoms`, `timestep`, `extrapolate_steps` (see :ref:`Parameters
section <parameters3>`)::

    dynamics = ...            # Initialise the dynamical system

The logger and crack tip movement detection functions can be left almost exactly
as before for now: we just need to make a small change to
the :func:`printstatus` function so to distinguish between extrapolation and
interpolation:

Change the line::

    atoms.info['label'] = 'D'                   # Label for the status line

to::

    atoms.info['label'] = dynamics.state_label  # Label for the status line

This uses the :attr:`~quippy.lotf.LOTFDynamica.state_label` attribute to print
an ``"E"`` at the beginning of the logger lines for extrapolation and an ``"I"``
for interpolation.


Updating the QM region
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We need to define a function that updates the QM region at the
beginning of each extrapolation cycle. As before, we need to find the
position of the crack tip and then update the :ref:`hysteretic
<hysteretic>` QM region. Note that now a previous QM region exists and
its atoms should be passed to the
:func:`~quippy.lotf.update_hysteretic_qm_region` function. The current
QM atom list can be obtained with the
:meth:`quippy.potential.ForceMixingPotential.get_qm_atoms` method. To
find the crack position, use
:func:`~quippy.crack.find_crack_tip_stress_field` as before, but pass
the MM potential as the calculator used to calculated the stresses
(force mixing potentials can only calculate forces, not per-atom
stresses; we will check later that the classical stress is
sufficiently accurate for locating the crack tip)::

    def update_qm_region(atoms):
        crack_pos = ...          # Find crack tip position
        qm_list = ...            # Get current QM atoms
        qm_list = ...            # Update hysteretic QM region
        qmmm_pot. ...            # Set QM atoms

   dynamics.set_qm_update_func(update_qm_region)


Writing the trajectory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Finally, we want to save frames to the trajectory every `traj_interval` time
steps but, this time, only during the interpolation phase of the
predictor-corrector cycle. To do this, we first initialise the trajectory file
(see :func:`~quippy.io.AtomsWriter`), and then define a function that only
writes to the trajectory file if the state of the dynamical systems is
`Interpolation`::

    trajectory = ... # Initialise trajectory using traj_file

    def traj_writer(dynamics):
        if dynamics.state == LOTFDynamics.Interpolation:
            trajectory.write(dynamics.atoms)

As before, we attach this function to the dynamical system, passing
`traj_interval` and extra argument of `dynamics` which gets passed along to the
`traj_writer` function (see the :meth:`~quippy.lotf.LOTFDynamics.attach`
method)::

    dynamics. ...    # Attach traj_writer to dynamics

Now, we can simply run the dynamics for `nsteps` steps::

    dynamics. ...    # Run dynamics for nsteps

If you are interested in seeing how the LOTF predictor-corrector cycle is
implemented, look at the documentation and `source code
<_modules/quippy/lotf.html#LOTFDynamics.step>`_ for the
:meth:`quippy.lotf.LOTFDynamics.step` routine.

Milestone 3.2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The finished version of the ``run_crack_lotf.py`` script should look something
like :ref:`run_crack_lotf`. To clearly show the differences with respect to the
classical MD script, here is a :download:`patch
<run_crack_classical_lotf.patch>` which could be used to convert the classical
script into the LOTF one.


3.3 Visualisation and Analysis (as time permits)
------------------------------------------------

Predictor/corrector dynamics output file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's first take a moment to look at the output of the script for the first
predictor/corrector cycle. Here we go through some example output, yours should
be similar. First there are a few lines about the initialisation of the system,
and then we get the results of the initial LOTF adjustable potential
optimisation::

    Loading atoms from file crack.xyz
    Fixed 240 atoms

    25 atoms selected for quantum treatment
    update_qm_region: QM region with 25 atoms centred on [-30.60517303   0.08401087   0.        ]
    Adding default springs
    Got 1484 springs
    Number of force components: 297
    Number of parameters:       1484
    Optimising 1484 adjustable parameters
    RMS force component error before optimisation : .05630875465645784
    Max force component error before optimisation : .34841292159055509
    Using SVD for least squares fit, eigenvalue threshold = .00000000010000000
    RMS force component error after  optimisation :   0.27E-02
    Max force component error after  optimisation :   0.61E-02
    Max abs spring constant   after  optimisation :   0.45E-01

You can see that before adjusting the parameters, the QM and classical potentials
differed by a maximum of 0.35 eV/A, with an RMS difference of 0.06 eV/A - in
this case the SW potential is actually doing a rather respectable job. After the
fit, which is this case involved 1484 spring parameters to fit 297 force
component, the force differences are of course much smaller.

Next we start the first predictor/corrector cycle. First we update the QM
region, and remap the adjustable potential to take account of any changes
since last time::

    25 atoms selected for quantum treatment
    update_qm_region: QM region with 25 atoms centred on [-30.6048418    0.08377744   0.        ]
    Adding default springs
    Got 1484 springs
    Number of force components: 297
    Number of parameters:       1484

As this is the first step, there were no changes, so no re-optimisation is
required. Next we carry out 10 steps of extrapolation, with constant LOTF
adjustable parameters. During this time the strain is incremented as normal::

    State      Time/fs    Temp/K     Strain      G/(J/m^2)  CrackPos/A D(CrackPos)/A
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    E            1.0  553.716406     0.08427      5.0012      -30.61    (-0.00)

    E            8.0  409.663780     0.08434      5.0095      -30.66    (-0.06)
    E            9.0  376.965040     0.08435      5.0107      -30.67    (-0.07)

At the end of the extrapolation, it's time for a QM force evaluation
and another fit. Now the force errors before fitting are a little
larger, but the fit is still very good::

    Optimising 1484 adjustable parameters
    RMS force component error before optimisation : .10494977522791650
    Max force component error before optimisation : .48515966905523733
    Using SVD for least squares fit, eigenvalue threshold = .00000000010000000
    RMS force component error after  optimisation :   0.37E-02
    Max force component error after  optimisation :   0.96E-02
    Max abs spring constant   after  optimisation :   0.83E-01

We next return to the initial dynamical state and re-run the dynamics,
interpolating between the optimised parameters at the two ends of the cycle.
Note that the strain is also returned to the initial value at :math:`t = 0`, and
that the temperature after one step exactly matches the interpolation phase
(since the forces and velocities at :math:`t = 0` are identical for
extrapolation and interpolation)::

    State      Time/fs    Temp/K     Strain      G/(J/m^2)  CrackPos/A D(CrackPos)/A

To continue from here, we simply go back to the extrapolation phase and then
repeat the entire cycle.

QM active and buffer regions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Trajectory analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open your new trajectory :ref:`as before <visualisation2>`, using the
:func:`~qlab.view` function from within a new `ipython` session, and
visualise the QM region by colouring the atoms using the
``hybrid_mark`` :attr:`property <quippy.atoms.Atoms.properties>` ::

   aux_property_coloring("hybrid_mark")

This property is used internally to identify which atoms are used for the QM
active and buffer regions:

.. image:: crack-hybrid-mark.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600

The central green atoms have ``hybrid_mark == HYBRID_ACTIVE_MARK``, and they are
the atoms for which QM forces are used to propagate the dynamics. Classical
forces are used for all other atoms, including the red buffer region, where
``hybrid_mark == HYBRID_BUFFER_MARK``. As explained :ref:`above <buffer>`, the
purpose of the buffer region is to give accurate QM forces on the active atoms.

.. _cluster:

If you want to see the actual cluster used for carrying out the embedded DFTB
calculation, you could use the :func:`~quippy.clusters.create_cluster_simple`
function together with the same `args_str` cluster options defined above::

   cluster = create_cluster_simple(gcat(),
                  args_str=("single_cluster cluster_periodic_z carve_cluster "
                            "terminate cluster_hopping=F randomise_buffer=F"))
   view(cluster)

Colouring the cluster by coordination (press `k`) can be useful to check that
all cut bonds have been correctly passivated by hydrogen atoms:

.. image:: lotf-crack-cluster.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600


Comparison between classical and LOTF dynamics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Step through your trajectory with the `Insert` and `Delete` keys to see what
happens in the LOTF dynamics. As before, you can jump to the end with
`Ctrl+Delete`. You should find that the dynamics is very different to the
classical case.

Check if the QM region is following the moving crack properly by looking at the
``hybrid_mark`` property. If you repeat the analysis of the :ref:`stress field
<stress_analysis>` carried out in :ref:`Step 2 <step2>`, you should find that
the :ref:`time averaged stress field <time_avg_stress>` is strongly concentrated
on the sharp crack tip. It is this stress field which is used
by :func:`~quippy.crack.find_crack_tip_stress_field` to follow the crack tip,
and hence to update the set of atoms in the QM region.

Here is a movie of a typical LOTF simulation on the :math:`(111)` cleavage
plane. To colour the QM atoms dark blue, we passed
the :func:`~qlab.highlight_qm_region` function as the `hook` argument
to :func:`~qlab.render_movie`:


.. video:: lotf-111 640 360

During the LOTF dynamics, the time-averaged stress field smoothly tracks the
crack tip, as can be seen in this movie, where atoms are coloured by
their :math:`\sigma_{yy}` component:

.. video:: elastic 640 360

And here is a head-to-head comparison of SW and LOTF dynamics:

.. video:: classical-vs-lotf 640 720

Fracture initiates much earlier in the LOTF case, i.e. at a much reduced energy
release rate, and is much more brittle, with none of the artificial plasticity
seen with the classical potential alone.

Note that if you continue the LOTF dynamics, however, we may see some defects in
the fracture surface after the crack has propagated for a few nm. These are
associated with the relatively small system and high strain rate we are using
here, which leads to fracture at high energies and possibly to high speed
fracture instabilities [Fineberg1991]_. If you have time you can investigate
this in the :ref:`extension task on size and strain rate effects
<system_size_and_strain_rate>`.

.. video:: clas-vs-lotf 640 720

Although it is beyond the scope of this tutorial, you might be interested to
know that using an overall larger system, bigger QM region and lower strain rate,
as well as changing the Hamiltonian from DFTB to DFT-GGA, removes all of these
defects, recovering perfectly brittle fracture propagation. The DFT model also
gives an improved description of the fracture surfaces, which reconstruct to
form a Pandey :math:`\pi`\ -bonded chain, with it's characteristic alternating
pentagons and heptagons:

.. video:: silicon-111-dft-1400 640 360

.. _plot_G_and_crack_pos_x_lotf:

Evolution of energy release rate and crack position
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you follow the :ref:`previous approach <plot_G_and_crack_pos_x>` to plot the
energy release rate `G` and crack position `crack_pos_x` variables during your
LOTF simulation, you should find that the crack now advances monotonically, with
a constant crack velocity of around 2500 m/s, and at about half the energy
release rate of the classical case (6 J/m\
:superscript:`2` vs 12 J/m\ :superscript:`2`).

.. image:: lotf-energy-release-rate-crack-position.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600

For comparison, here is the classical plot again:

.. image:: energy-release-rate-crack-position.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600

You should find that the :ref:`temperature <plot_temperature>` still goes up,
but more gently than in the classical case, since the flow of energy to the
crack tip is closer to the energy consumed by creating the new surfaces. Some
heat is generated at the QM/MM border; usually this would be controlled with a
gentle Langevin thermostat, which we have omitted here in the interests of
simplicity.

.. _low_speed_instability:

Low speed instability on the (111) cleavage plane
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are lucky, you may see the formation of a crack tip reconstruction
consisting of a 5 and a 7 membered ring on the lower fracture surface,
related to the Pandey surface reconstruction.

.. image:: lotf-crack-step-1.png
   :width: 400
   :align: center

This reconstruction can cause cracks to take a step down by one atomic layer,
which over time can build up via positive feedback mechanism into an
experimentally observable phenomena [Kermode2008]_.

.. _pred_corr_error:


3.4 Checking the predictor/corrector force errors (optional)
------------------------------------------------------------

Add `check_force_error=True` to the :class:`~quippy.lotf.LOTFDynamics`
constructor. This causes the LOTF routines to do a reference QM force evaluation
at every timestep (note that these extra QM forces are not used in the fitting,
so the dynamical trajectory followed is the same as before).

When checking the predictor/corrector errors, you need to disable the updating of
the QM region by commenting out the line::

   dynamics.set_qm_update_func(update_qm_region)

Let's create a logfile to save the force errors at each step during
the interpolation and extrapolation. Add the following code before the
:meth:`dynamics.run()` call::

    def log_pred_corr_errors(dynamics, logfile):
        logfile.write('%s err %10.1f%12.6f%12.6f\n' % (dynamics.state_label,
                                                       dynamics.get_time()/units.fs,
                                                       dynamics.rms_force_error,
                                                       dynamics.max_force_error))
    logfile = open('pred-corr-error.txt', 'w')
    dynamics.attach(log_pred_corr_errors, 1, dynamics, logfile)

Finally, change the total number of steps (via the `nsteps` parameter) to a much
smaller number (e.g. 200 steps), close the logfile after the ``dynamics.run()``
line::

    logfile.close()

Once the dynamics have run for a few LOTF cycles, you can plot the results with
a shell script called ``plot_pred_corr_errors.py``::

   plot_pred_corr_errors.py -e 10 pred-corr-error.txt

The ``-e 10`` argument is used to specify the number of extrapolate steps. This
produces a set of four plots giving the RMS and maximum force errors during
extrapolation and interpolation:

.. image::  lotf_check_force_error.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600

Note that the scale is different on the extrapolation and interpolation plots!
Try varying the `extrapolate_steps` parameter and seeing what the effect on
force errors is. What is the largest acceptable value? You could also try
changing the `lotf_spring_hops` and `fit_hops` parameters, which control the
maximum length of the corrective springs added to the potential and the size of
the fit region, respectively.

Milestone 3.4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here is a final version of the ``run_crack_lotf.py`` script including
checking of the force errors: :download:`run_crack_lotf.py`.


Further extension tasks
-----------------------

.. _qm_region_size:

QM region size
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Investigate the effect of increasing the QM region size, controlled by the
`qm_inner_radius` and `qm_outer_radius` parameters. When does the behaviour
converge qualitatively? What does this say about the size of the 'process zone'
in silicon?

.. _buffer_region_size:

Buffer region size
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have used a hysteretic buffer region from 7 A to 9 A. How would you check if
this is sufficient? What criteria need to be satisfied for our results to be
considered to be converged with respect to buffer region size?

.. _freund:

Crack energy-speed relationship
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Try varying the flow of energy to the crack tip by changing the `initial_G`
parameter used when making the crack system in :ref:`step1`. How does this
affect the speed of the crack?

.. _other_orientations:

Other crack orientations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Return to the beginning of :ref:`step1` and try classical and/or LOTF dynamics
(which will actually probably be faster!) on the :math:`(110)` surface. Do you
see any major differences? Can you find any dynamic fracture instabilities?

.. _system_size_and_strain_rate:

System size and strain rate effects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What is the effect of changing the system size on the critical energy
release rate for fracture? How would you converge with respect to this
parameter? Do you think experimental length scales can be reached? If
not, does it matter? Think about how the choice of loading geometry
helps here.

As well as finite size effects, and perhaps more severely, we are limited in the
time scales that can be accessed by our fracture simulations, especially when
using a QM method to describe the crack tip processes. Are there any scaling
relations that can help us out here? How would you estimate the effect of the
artificially high strain rate we have been forced to impose here.
